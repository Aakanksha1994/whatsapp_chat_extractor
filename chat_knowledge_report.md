# WhatsApp Chat Summary

## Overall Chat Summary

Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. Only people in this chat can read, listen to, or share them. You changed the group name to “Let’s Vibe and Code!”
Nishant, Amit, Kshitij, Ayush, Suraj Prajapati, Rahul Verma, Vinay Garg are some of the members of the group.
I am waiting for everyone to join, as I sent the invite today evening only. I am looking to learn how to build highly functional apps and websites to allow for faster and easier testing.
Ankit Rawat joined using this group's invite link. He is working as a Robotics Engineer at Samsung R&D Delhi. He knows coding and has implemented research papers on AI for his first startup.
Aakanksha: I’ve been exploring AI tools for a while & started learning Cursor a couple of weeks ago. I genuinely believe the best way to learn is by building - and when you build with others, the learning multiplies. Aakansha is a 6-time hackathon winner, including ETHIndia 2022.
At Gojek, I was one of the youngest engineers on the core infrastructure team. Since then, I’ve led technical efforts across startups in blockchain, event management, real estate, and developer tools. In just the past 2 months, I've shipped over 10 mini, production-ready applications.
Vinay garg is an IITK 2014 graduate - Maths and Stats. He is currently based in Jaipur, working on a venture in Food and Beverage.
The group will be using vibe coding tools. The aim is to get comfortable building simple products using these tools. Aviraj will pick a starter project for everyone to build individually.
Cursor is not a passive teaching group. You'll get the most out of it by actively building, asking questions, and helping each other. constructive, polite feedback is always welcome.
Vivek is from the SOM IITB '16 batch. He works in Data management and Analytics space. He uses chatgpt a lot for his work related activities.
Just type a prompt and see what it makes. It builds a full next.js website automatically, it's pretty cool. If you make something fun, drop a screenshot here. Looking forward to the sessions.
Try Lovable. rtable with VS Code or another editor, that's totally fine too, use whatever makes you faster. It's better with the UI part.
Ankur joined using this group's invite link. It was a 50-50 vote, but majority leans toward tomorrow at 9 PM - so locking that in for the session. If you can, definitely join live. It’s much easier to do the setup together.
Some of these don’t seem to open. Would love to checkout all of them! It’s hard to manage all but which one are not opening?
Ankur Kaushik is a product manager at a startup(TapFin) in Mumbai. He is working with ChatGPT and working prototypes with Lovable/ bolt.
Session will be held tomorrow night at 9pm. Download Cursor, create a GitHub account and log in via GitHub. Try opening a new workspace and just explore the UI a bit.
Aviraj Khare is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting. We will share the Zoom link just before the meeting here only. Please share the meeting recordings when possible. The application requires macOS 11.0 or later.
There are two recordings. One in her MacBook and one in mine. I found Tempo Labs interesting as it provides with PRD details & userflow followed by allowing user to add components in the user flow as well.
Here is the Part 1: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7tJjRFDDD2bblhtE8s2l6FrT7ZYvN9j/view?usp=sharing. The Part 2: http://www.dropbox.com/.com/s/15dvMUrDF-Cie2JLZqxqeBYl3FCfnpEGp?usp =sharing.
There are guys from Jaipur building this product. It’s easy to benchmark by asking platform to generate past year questions and cross checking with actual past year paper. I will try to make this today.
Ajay Suwalka is originally from Bhilwara but currently live in Bangalore. He specializes in community building, developing AI solutions for companies, and assisting organizations in hiring.
I am Amul, I work in product at a US based retailer, I am trying to pivot & crack a full stack dev role in next few months. I am able to code simple applications/tools in Rust using cursor / windsurf. Now trying to build full-stack apps, and this is where I'd love to get feedback from this group.
Hitanshu Gandhi is a Director with PwC Strategy&, chasing the partnership dream. He used to code for pocket money for sports quota computer science folks in USA.
Some notes from using cursor / windsurf for > 400 hours over last 6 months. LLMs should be treated as search + assimilation tools, you have to bias them.
Documenting your steps & learnings is a cumulative skill so constantly document your prompts, steps and learnings. Use the inal pattern, also helps you avoid mistakes early enough.
 create file named r07_explain_architecture.txt which will contain the explanation of the architecture of the PRD. This file should leverage a relationship of consistency with r05_arch_L1.txt. with r04_prd_v2.txt + r02_domain_analysis.txt- Create file named. r06_arch-L2.xt which is basically a rubber-duck debugging of the. architecture.
The group is looking for people who want to implement the TDD plan in the most idiomatic bug-free way possible line by line. The TDD methodology of starting with Red Test, then Green Test and then Refactor will be used.
Anupam Gupta joined using this group's invite link. Raju Mude requested to join the group. Prateek Chaturvedi joined the group to learn more about AI.
This week I am trying different mcp servers and how it can be integrated with Claude desktop. I will build one live before jumping to complex integrations where Claude Desktop will be orchestrating between multiple mCP servers. Then we can dive deep into Google’s A2A framework.
MCP is standardising how we fetch data from a source in uniform way. But do they really have a business use case? Or just a hype?
Prakhar this side from IITB. Have been tinkering with lovable, V0, bolt, databutton for some time now. Have 13+ years of experience (ex-Amazon, WalamrtLabs, Oracle and eBay)
Devyesh is a growth manager at Jupiter Money. Has built multiple web and mobile apps via vibe coding on Cursor. Has used tools like lovable, elevenlabs, n8n before.
After hours of efforts  and a lot of debugging help from @919893371444 I was able to create this. I will try to document the process + bugs I ran into and share it here soon. Hopefully it helps others too!
Mukund Kushwaha from IIT Bomb is the founder of the group. Mukund joined using this group's invite link. He is also the co-founder of IIT-Bomb. He has been working on the group for a month.
I made something during my endsems with code and you all can try (if you are a heavy sleeper) I set up for tomorrow, let's see how it works, i have thought about having an interactive alarm in past.
Praveen Sampath joined using this group's invite link. He is planning a session on MCP, that will also cover integrating multiple systems.
This is not just another “AI hype” group. We’re here to actually build things. Whether you're a beginner or already building, this space is for sharing learnings, breaking through roadblocks, and compounding growth.
 AI/ML engineering or product builders who love to share? Share the invite link with them. Share product demos, resources, workflows. Run short hands-on sessions if you’re up for it.
I’ll start documenting learnings from the group: useful product links, tools, bugs, and session recordings. Over time it becomes a shared repository for all of us. If anyone wants to volunteer or contribute to this, let me know!
The first night I moved to the pro account I ate up nearly 20% of my requests. Can you remove my phone number from Vapi dashboard? I think there is no option to unschedule a call.
Sagar Mandhani is a product manager and 0-to-1 consultant for founders. He is hoping to build and ship some of the tens and hundreds of ideas he has on a monthly basis.
I'm Sachin Doifode, IITB'22. I'm working in TI and want to build some tools which can be used in semiconductor domain to ease different processes present in front end and back end.
If you are struggling with Cursor - try Grok / Super Grok - hq output - just need above kinda scripts to export the code and config to txt files. Never use chatgpt from consumer side, far more reliable on b2b2c side.
Suryansh, IIT-B’18 batch currently in product and strategy at Swiggy. Exploring use-cases for biz / product side (with very little prior coding experience) and PKM / second brain / productivity workflows on personal side.
Pallav Uttam, 2008 IITB, working mostly with startups like Swiggy and currently with PriceLabs in product and growth roles. Sudhir Shenoy, 1994 IIT B alumnus. Started and grew a Cloud Telephony Venture in 2011.
Vibe can be used to develop simple web applications WITHOUT having a lot of technical skills. Would love to build a simple web application and see it work. Hoping to learn from all of you and get some help when I struggle.
 LLMs should be treated as search + assimilation tools, you have to bias them with right keywords. LLMs need to follow TDD because it makes it easier to arrive at the final code.
Standard Operating Procedure I follow when I try to code a product. Create a new folder for context retention docs called aa_ref_01. Create file named r02_domain_analysis.txt which will contain the best of the conversation we have with tab nine or @web.
- Create a file named r07_explain_architecture.txt which will contain the explanation of the architecture of the PRD. This file should leverage a relationship of consistency with r05_arch_L1.txt + r04_prd_v2.txt & r02_domain_analysis.txt.- Create file named. r08_TDD_v1.xt which will basically ask the LLM to write a TDD plan to implement the r06_arch.L2.
Cursor rules are a good way to test and refactor code. I have a template somewhere - I'll share got it from mcwrigly's course on twitter.
Python best practices say 7-10 lines at best. Loggin is fine but long methods are a big problem. Context window might be a problem - they don't get a specific request if they are overflowing.
Sujal Sahoo is a 2nd-year undergrad at the University of Toronto. He is the co-founder of a group dedicated to refactoring code. Sujal is currently working on a code refactor for his code.
I am Shamit Monga,  IITB,2011. Heading Product at Infurnia. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts. Let's connect, share ideas, and create something awesome together!
Looking to pick up skills to code and deploy more complex applications. Was a civil servant prior to this. Was looking to start a design software company.
Vote below to finalise the timing for a 2-hour build session this Saturday. We’ll all get together, discuss a project, and build it live as a group.
Rachit gupta, IITB 2012 grad, currently working on his startup in recruitment space. Rachit: We can create a common space, GitHub or drive whatever works best to track the knowledge we are sharing.
Kapil Yadav joined using this group's invite link. He is building a website without any help and has no knowledge about coding language used in website building.
Is there any tool for data extraction? I have a large csv file and I want to read it row by row and with each row information I want some data to be extracted and exported. We are building it today for our project today. Can share with you once done.
Aviraj Khare Tapri is a solution architect for banks in the Europe and Americas regions. He's been programming for more than 15 years and wants to try coding again.
TDD deserves it’s own session :) Not currently. Came to hometown for some time. Bringing together experienced folks to cross learn. We will drop the meeting link here tomorrow.
Cursor Set-up and Chit Chat will be held on Saturday, May 10 at 2:15 – 2:50pm. Vibe-coding Hands-on session will take place on the same day.
Loved the session! Will attend next one. You can go through video 2, that covers “how to prompt” cursor in short.
Thanks Aviraj and Akanksha for the great session today. I am a newbie to AI tools, my exposure/ usage is limited to chatgpt. I want to learn to build prototypes and find tools that help me as a PM.
Fireflies was enabled in meeting. llm as orchestration layer are great and still we don’t know it’s full potential. g unstructured data into structured data.

- Welcome everyone!
Just sharing how this group will work and what to expect:
Goal:
Everyone ships at least one personal product by the end of May.
Focus:
The aim is to get comfortable building simple products using vibe coding tools.
We'll mainly focus on Cursor this month — not trying to master every tool out there.
If you're comfortable with other tools (Replit, Windsurf, etc.), feel free to use them.
Plan:
To kick things off, Aviraj will pick a starter project for everyone to build individually in Cursor.
This will come with a lot of guidance, and should help you get familiar with Cursor, Git, Vercel, and basic workflows.
Important:
We are taking time out to share learnings for free, so please be respectful of that.
If you're not getting what you need, feel free to share polite feedback — if it’s manageable, we'll try to help.
This is not a passive teaching group. You'll get the most out of it by actively building, asking questions, and helping each other.
We’re figuring this out together — constructive, polite feedback is always welcome.
Stay active — the more you put in, the more you’ll get out.
Mandatory Notes:
Please introduce yourself following the template in the group description.
Be respectful — most of us are beginners here.
Let’s get started :)

Spent around 4 years to understand day to day challenges and how technology can be integrated to make life easy for architects , engineers and contractors.
Co-founded a vertical SaaS for the industry and currently serving 1000+ paid b2b users.
Looking forward to learn tech tools to make a product for event management company.
Thanks
- Hi Everyone,
Naveen here from SOM IITB '16 batch. Works in Data management and Analytics space. Left coding more than 10 yrs ago. uses chatgpt a lot for my work related activities.
Really interested to understand the art of the possible using the vibe coding.
Also, hats off to all the organizers for giving  their time and effort for this initiative.  Looking forward to the sessions.
Thanks
- very inspiring Vivek 🙂 what is your start-up called?

- hey everyone,
if you get like 10-15 mins today, try opening https://v0.dev/ — just type a prompt and see what it makes.
it builds a full next.js website automatically, it's pretty cool.
just play around a bit, and if you make something fun, drop a screenshot here 👀 ‎<This message was edited>

- I tried on phone.
- Deploy it
- https://v0-portfolio-website-two-self.vercel.app/ - only gave my CV and asked to make portfolio - it created this in 2 minutes, and i can edit everything either via prompts or via changing in code directly
- Would we be required to use an IDE like VS Code for developing projects?
- Try Lovable. It's better with the UI part. ‎<This message was edited>
- https://lovable.dev/login
- I use it for creating basic wireframes for my PRDs! ‎<This message was edited>
- ‎You deleted this message.
- _important architectural distinction between workflows and agents:_
_Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks_
https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents
- Reminder ‎<This message was edited>
- How do you create wireframes? I played with it today, exhausted the credit limit. But, can I ask for wireframes directly?
- Was there any token limit for this?
- https://v0.dev/community/real-time-sand-painter-TBiOoSpC1gi

Don’t worry if you can’t attend -  we’ll try to record it.
But if you can, definitely join live. It’s much easier to do the setup together, break that initial friction, and get started.
Any issues you face can be solved then and there - and we’ll continue helping each other in the group too.

- I'm gonna try it this week
- Joined yesterday, a bit about myself:
Name: Ankur Kaushik
Working as product manager at a startup(TapFin) in Mumbai
Exp with AI: research and ideation with ChatGPT, working prototypes with Lovable/ bolt
Why this group: highly interested to upskill in AI
- गुलाबी शहर में, बरसों बाद,
दिल को मिला ठिकाना।
तेरा प्यार ओढ़कर, मैं,
जैसे पाया नया जमाना।
I generated this with the poem generator 😶
- @919893371444 - what's the NutriLens project? is it something like where we can post our food photos and it will generate nutritional content?
- yeah. its that
- https://studio.botpress.cloud/df04c245-5111-48b3-ae7a-54f58ba89f77/home - @919893371444 - is it better than cursor to build AI agents?
- This is a goldmine to develop with cursor - https://x.com/paraschopra/status/1917466537637859544
- @919893371444 can we please follow some of these practices while building today in workshop?
- @919167279530
https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools
This has some system prompts for Ai dev Tools.
- I am not very experienced either but I faced difficulties with cursor last week when trying to build simple products, it was most probably bcz I directly gave very broad prompts, so I am now trying to optimise on that
- Sure

- Hello!
Pushkar here. PM at Zynga. Trying different tools right now.
Currently I just want to play with vibe coding.
Trying to build small personal projects which I always wanted to build but didn’t have a tech counter part. Also thinking of ways if these ideas could be monetised later. ‎<This message was edited>
- Thank you, Aakanksha!
Hello, everyone! This is Ajay Suwalka. I'm originally from Bhilwara but currently live in Bangalore.
I specialize in community building, developing AI solutions for companies, and assisting organizations in hiring for AI, ML, and tech roles.
In addition to my work, I enjoy budget travel.
I'm happy to be here!
Best,
Ajay
- do you have any project ideas, you want to build?
- @917506112199
- Hello Everyone!
I’m Nikkitha. I live in Barcelona
and currently work in Sanofi as Data scientist.
I wanted to explore and get better at vibe coding.
Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and fitness.
- I thought Barcelona people didn't care about these things 😅
- I was building Splitwise on web for splitting expenses with my flatmates. Did a basic MVP but exhausted the free credits from cursor. So left it there for now.
Yesterday I was I trying to build a resume builder. Idea is to build it for tier 2-3 India and see if it could be monetised later.
- I’m trying to get my hands dirty before Barcelona people get to know about this 😜
- First mover advantage :)
- Hey everyone
I am Amul
currently work in product at a US based retailer, I am trying to pivot & crack a full stack dev role in next few months
I am able to code simple applications/tools in Rust using cursor / windsurf
now trying to build full-stack apps, and this is where I'd love to get feedback from this group & share what I know with those who seek help here
I often rant on twitter.com/amuldotexe
- Fun fact: @919611256611 is OG vibe coder. He even taught me how to vibe code before term vibe code came into existence :)
- Sir you are an actual coder who overestimates me
I just try to persuade the LLM to do my bidding while you actually know how to build reliable software

- Hi Aakanksha!
Thanks for adding me to this group. Ill start with my very limited experience of using cursor.
I started using cursor very recently. The first night I moved to the pro account I ate up nearly 20% of my requests.
Me and a friend took around 2 months to build content clustering pipeline around ~ 10 years back. I am myself awe struck to see that I was able to build a working prototype in less than 3 days. Happy to contribute in ways this group finds it meaningful.
I had a question for people who have exhausted their monthly requests in the past. How useful is cursor after that? I experimented with cursor small ans was massively disappointed.
- Can you remove my phone number from Vapi dashboard 😅 I think there is no option to unschedule a call
- Best guide for prompt engineering so far: https://www.promptingguide.ai/
- may be @919611256611 can help
- ‎~ Vikas Kumar requested to join
- I'd ask you to use Tab nine
it's as good as cursor if you know how to query it and provide context
cursor is good till Claude - else it's not as good

- if you are struggling with Cursor - try Grok / Super Grok - hq output - just need above kinda scripts to export the code and config to txt files.
- code flattner it is.
nice. i like this one more: https://gitingest.com/
- Why haven't you mentioned Chatgpt? Is it not good for code review/debugging?
- Chatgpt dilutes it's models regularly
no trust
you start creating workflows based on new release & then after a couple of weeks the models are diluted to point that you feel interrupted
- Also never use chatgpt from consumer side, far more reliable on the b2b2c side
as in via windsurf / cursor it's far better

- A bit late but here is about me - Pallav here, 2008 IITB, been working mostly with startups like Swiggy and currently with PriceLabs in product and growth roles. Have also been a founder
Have tried building things using Cursor, but havent been able to build a full fledged working prototype and do struggle with prompts. Would love to collaborate with fellow builders and launch things ‎<This message was edited>
- Did you start something? Which we can help you with?
- Hi..I am Sudhir Shenoy…1994 IIT B alumnus. Have been in the tech industry ever since. Started of as a developer but moved into techno-functional roles in Enrteprise software. Then did an MBA from ISB and was leading Product Management responsibility with Yahoo. Started and grew a Cloud Telephony Venture in 2011. Came back to a corporate job with Verisign. Have attempted a couple of side-gigs in the Saas market but now on the verge of doing something entrepreneurial full time (soon).
Am very keen to understand how far these Vibe coding tools can be used to develop simple web applications WITHOUT having a lot of technical skills (😅).
Would love to build a simple web application and see it work. Hoping to learn from all of you and get some help when I struggle 😁.
- Yeah have an idea which I want to bring to life
- Happy to pair for your first exploration - anything specific you'd like to build ?
my limited experience tells me those who understand architecture x deployment can get working prototype - but specificity is difficult because you actually don't know how things are built and can't give the right nudges to the LLM
- Yes .. I do have a simple first web application in mind - to give this a spin mainly. Will formulate the goal in a structured manner and share with you ! Thank you for agreeing to pair with me 😊
- I'll share a couple of notes I shared previously which might be worth marinating
- Curious. What are your thoughts on cursor rules? Do you use them?
- ‎This message was deleted.
- My hypothesis is:
You become effective if you can follow a workflow and not struggle with avoidable problems
- One problem I have been facing is regarding the methods claude spits out. In my cursor rules files, I mentioned that dont give me long methods, but I hardly every get that. At the same time, my cursor rules say log everything important and claude does that. Gemini/deepseek however dont do any of it. ‎<This message was edited>
- Loggin is fine but long methods are a big problem
- Context window might be a problem - they don't get a specific request if they are overflowing

- You can give the URL to cursor.
Paste it there and tell cursor build me an MCP server to do XYZ based on this doc

- Thanks, will try v0.dev.
I started from bolt.new and then moved to guthub copilot for changes.
- Maybe. Let’s do that tomorrrow.
1. Make website on v0
2. ⁠clone it to vercel and clone to GitHub also
3. ⁠pull on local machine and do changes via Cursor or Windsurf.
- What's time for tomorrow
- Perfect!
- As majority voted for 3-5, we will connect at that time
- We will try to record it
- We are building it today for our project today. Can share with you once done.
- Share the approach and if possible solution here too Siddharth
- have you used it? How is it compared to cursor and windsurf

- Where is the session happening tomorrow?
- Can we also include how to build all the docs from ideation to tdd implementation plan in the session also. From my limited used of cursor and social media lurking, I have realized its important getting the docs in order before we write code.

Recently, I have joined an org where we are trying to build a voice agent for recruitment space.
I am a newbie to AI tools, my exposure/usage is limited to chatgpt.
Via this community, I want to learn to build prototypes and find tools that help me as a PM.
- Thank you Aakansksha and Aviraj for the session.
It helped for a beginner like me to set things up, and use it got future
- One thing llms are good at is converting unstructured data into structured data. llm as orchestration layer are great and still we don’t know it’s full potential

- Hi, Harshita this side, Meta DD, IITB' 20. I was previously working as a Product manager at Miko, robotics startup. Currently on a career break and figuring out the next steps in my career.
Fascinated towards building something using AI tools. I do have an idea for a project. I have tried out a few AI tools like Lovabale, Bolt, Replit, Readdy.ai. keep on attending online webinars around AI. Looking forward to our interactions in the group 🙌🏻
- Hey everyone! 👋
I’m excited to be here alongside Aakansha to help guide you through AI-assisted coding!
A bit about me: I’m a 6-time hackathon winner, including ETHIndia 2022—one of the largest blockchain hackathons globally. My journey spans the entire product lifecycle—from building from scratch (0→1), scaling early products (1→100), to growing systems to massive scale (100x and beyond).
At Gojek, I was one of the youngest engineers on the core infrastructure team, working on platforms that powered the company’s hyper-growth. Since then, I’ve led technical efforts across startups in blockchain, event management, real estate, and developer tools. In just the past 2 months, I’ve shipped over 10 mini, production-ready applications!
I’m a generalist across frontend, backend, and platform engineering, with a strong focus on building resilient platforms and moving fast from idea to execution.
Looking forward 🙂
- Not necessarily.
Cursor itself is built on top of VS Code, so it feels very similar.
If you're already comfortable with VS Code or another editor, that's totally fine too, use whatever makes you faster.
- For website I tried out Readdy.ai it's good too
- ‎~ Ankur joined using this group's invite link
- For working prototype, I directly use lovable, with a precise prompt (created using ai tool).
Interested to know that does using Readdy.ai add any significant value?
- Hey everyone!
Before tomorrow’s session, please do the following so we can hit the ground running:
1. Download Cursor – from https://www.cursor.sh
2. Create a GitHub account – if you don’t have one already
3. Install Cursor & log in via GitHub
4. (Optional but helpful) Try opening a new workspace and just explore the UI a bit
Don’t worry if you face issues -  we’ll walk through setup again during the session. But doing this in advance will save time and help you get started faster.
See you all at 9 PM!
- We will share the Zoom link just before the meeting here only
- @919167279530 - Can you share the recording link if available?
- Hi everyone, Check out this article I came across on substack - https://www.digestibleux.com/p/vibe-coding-ux-approach-breakdown?r=9t8xs&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false
Good 10 min read to figure out which tool to start with as per your goal with the vibe coding project. I found Tempo Labs interesting as it provides with PRD details & userflow followed by allowing user to add components in the user flow as well. In case anyone here has used it please share your project and your experience with this tool.

- Another fun fact is Amul actually tried to get me into vibe coding back in Nov last year. He introduced me, set me up with Cursor, and basically nudged me to start my coding journey (which I later dropped, lol). But honestly, that moment gave me confidence, and a glimpse that maybe coding is something I could actually enjoy.
Beyond that, Amul is Twitter-famous, he shares super detailed and well-structured threads on everything from jobs and careers to life insights. Honestly, I’d be doing him a disservice trying to summarize it here, just go check out his profile.
- Thanks for the invite - unlike others, I am a Vibe Coding Support Dad 🙂
I am Hitanshu Gandhi - who once upon a time gave up his VLSI design dreams / TI job offer to do an MBA hoping he would peacefully sell sabun tel for life. Little did he ever know tech would come for all jobs - esp his, strategy consulting.
Currently a Director with PwC Strategy&, chasing the partnership dream - https://www.linkedin.com/in/hitanshugandhi/ is me, and I occasionally write some thoughtful gyan posts under #idleubermusings
So, yes, I hang out with my son who is vibe-automating his Trash Collecting Robot - https://firstprincipletechie.com/2025/02/17/testing-ecodrifter-2-0-in-yamuna-jawahar-tunnel/
My primary job is to ensure he doesn't give up, and help debug the rare moments when Claude fails
PS: I used to code for pocket money ~20+ years back - making assignments for sports quota computer science folks in USA 🙃Since then, only VBA, and a lot of it
- Some notes from using cursor / windsurf for > 400 hours over last 6 months
I'd love to know your thoughts on this
Principles I use:
a. LLMs should be treated as search + assimilation tools, you have to bias them with right keywords
b. LLMs need to iterate to arrive at a more refined output
c. LLMs need to summarize information which will lost by the sliding context window, hence you constantly create new docs which are in sync with previous docs
d. LLMs need to be asked to reason themselves so they can find their own logical fallacies, like rubber duck debugging
e. LLMs need to be given reference files for patterns to avoid, be it via past bugs or anti patterns to avoid
f. LLMs need to follow TDD because it makes it easier to arrive at the final code - it is an easier prediction problem if you know what will be the requisite final pattern, also helps you avoid mistakes early enough
g. LLM whispering is a cumulative skill so constantly document your prompts, steps & learnings

We did our first session last week with Aviraj, and I know it wasn’t perfect. I realized that expectations were a bit different from what I had in mind. But that’s okay — this will be a process.
I’ll start documenting learnings from the group: useful product links, tools, bugs, and session recordings — so over time it becomes a shared repository for all of us.
If anyone wants to volunteer or contribute to this, let me know!
And just a reminder: this isn’t a passive learning group. You’ll get the most out of it by participating actively. We have some very experienced folks take advantage
think of it as a year long journey

### Tips
- Hi everyone, Aakanksha here IITB ‘16
I started my career at Shell and spent the last 4 years building products in supply chain and B2C space. Currently doing freelance work helping clients automate AI workflows.
I’ve been exploring AI tools for a while & started learning Cursor a couple of weeks ago. I genuinely believe the best way to learn is by building - and when you build with others, the learning multiplies. That’s the idea behind this group, I am hoping something great comes out of this for each of us😊
- tried multiple times
- Standard Operating Procedure I follow when I try to code a product - using the above principles
- Create a new folder for context retention docs called aa_ref_01
- Create file named
r01_initial_ideation.txt for just noting down all the ideas without any structure
- Create file named r02_domain_analysis.txt which will contain the best of the conversation we have with tab nine or @web in order summarize the best domain knowledge needed for the problem statement
- Create file named
r03_prd_v1.txt which will be the first PRD for the user journey at a high level
- Create file named
r04_prd_v2.txt which hopefully is a more precise version of the previous PRD based on multiple iterations on the previous file
- Create file named
r05_arch_L1.txt which will contain the first attempt at the architecture of the PRD - this file should leverage a relationship of consistency with r04_prd_v2.txt + r02_domain_analysis.txt
- Create file named
r06_arch_L2.txt which will contain the second iteration of the architecture of the PRD - this file should leverage a relationship of consistency with r05_arch_L1.txt + r04_prd_v2.txt + r02_domain_analysis.txt
- Create file named r07_explain_architecture.txt which will contain the explanation of the architecture of the PRD - this file should leverage a relationship of consistency with r06_arch_L2.txt + r04_prd_v2.txt + r02_domain_analysis.txt. This file is basically a rubber-duck debugging of the architecture with us as the listener who wants to make sure that the r06_arch_L2.txt is well thought out
- Create a file named
r08_TDD_v1.txt which will basically ask the LLM to write a TDD plan to implement the r06_arch_L2.txt in the most minimalistic way possible, it should be consistent with r04_prd_v2.txt & r02_domain_analysis.txt
- If the r08_TDD_v1.txt is good enough, then select each step of the TDD plan as a checkbox - and ask the strong LLM (code LLM) to implement the TDD plan in the most idiomatic bug-free way possible line by line, thoroughly following the TDD methodology of starting with Red Test, then Green Test, then Refactor
- Create a file named
r09_bug_log.txt to note copy all the bugs encountered in the process of implementing the TDD plan
- Create a file named
r10_avoid_bugs.txt which will contain meta patterns and best practices discovered during the implementation of the TDD plan
- Create UAT plan for the whole feature, ideally this should be very close to r04_prd_v2.txt - and manually check the results, and document them in r11_uat_results.txt
- This week I am trying different mcp servers and how it can be integrated with Claude desktop.
A list of mcp servers is provided here: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
This week let’s explore and I will build one live before jumping to complex integrations where Claude Desktop will be orchestrating between multiple mcp servers :)
- Hello junta!
I’m Devyesh (IITB Aero, 2017). I got mesmerised by vibe coding recently. Have built multiple web and mobile apps via vibe coding on Cursor.
Glad to connect with everyone!
- sometimes press multiple times get a joke
- hey this is very cool Mukund! @919167279530 an idea, if Mukund is ok with it, can he take a class for us slower kids to teach how to build an app like this (basically integrating multiple systems)?
- @919893371444 is also planning a session on MCP, that will also cover integrating multiple systems
- Hi everyone!
Most of the folks who showed interest have now joined, so I wanted to share a bit of context on why I started this group.
I began learning Cursor just 2–3 weeks ago and quickly realized: this is a long journey. To really get good at building with these tools, I’ll need to stay consistent and keep shipping. So I thought - why not create a small, focused group of people who also want to build, learn together, and help each other stay on track?
It started as a small experiment. But with the number of requests I got, I decided to expand it into a larger community of folks who care about building with AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Replit, etc.
What this group is (and isn’t):
This is not just another “AI hype” group. We’re here to actually build things. Whether you’re a beginner or already building, this space is for sharing learnings, breaking through roadblocks, and compounding growth together.
Special thanks to @919893371444, who has strong engineering experience and has been generous in sharing his learnings. He's helping guide a lot of us through the early phases.
How you can contribute:
Beginners
– Ask questions
– Share what you're trying to build
– Post blockers
Experienced folks
– Share product demos, resources, workflows
– Run short hands-on sessions if you’re up for it
Everyone
– Post useful links, examples, articles
– Know someone who can contribute - AI/ML engineering or product builders who love to share? Share the invite link with them.
Coming up:
– I’ll host onboarding sessions for beginners if there are any so that you can kickstart the journey (Cursor setup, GitHub, etc.)
– For experienced folks, we can take complex products and build them in live sessions, happy to take suggestions here
Also: I’ve received a lot of DMs with strong intent. But many of you haven’t introduced yourselves in the group yet. At least break that first wall — say hi, share your intent, let’s use this space well.
And just a reminder: I’ll be asking small, silly questions openly — feel free to do the same. ‎<This message was edited>

- Came across this. Few good prompts: https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules
- Any tips and tricks to get cursor for free ? 😛
- I had a suggestion, we can create a common space, GitHub or drive whatever works best to track the knowledge we are sharing here.
For example a cursor rules file or instructions on how to breakdown tasks before prompting cursor
- good suggestion Rachit, and thanks for your introduction too 🙂
I’ll at least put together a repo of everything related to building that’s been shared in the group so far
can you help us set-up the shared file which we as a group can maintain/develop?

### Examples
- Have been listening a lot about MCPs and have used some products around it too
But do they really have a business use case? Or just a hype
- Getting it, any use cases but?
- could that be the case?
- any free api in that case
- Hi everyone! 😊
I need to create a product demo that includes *screen recording* and an *AI voice-over*.
Can anyone suggest a good tool or platform that makes this easy and professional?
Thanks in advance! 🙏
- Hi All,
I’m Suryansh, IIT-B’18 batch currently in product and strategy at Swiggy. Newbie to vibe coding. Exploring use-cases for biz / product side (with very little prior coding experience) and PKM / second brain / productivity workflows on personal side.
- I have a template somewhere - I'll share got it from mcwrigly guy's course on twitter
the essence of that file is to tell the LLM to be specific and not be lazy
more important is the set of prompts we use as a routine - I feel claude models are optimised for the code usecase only
- Hi everyone!
Dropping a poll below to finalise the timing for a 2-hour build session this Saturday. We’ll all get together, discuss a project, and build it live as a group.
It’s mainly for beginners like me who are still figuring things out and want to get more hands-on.
If any experienced folks are free and up for it — please let us know! You could showcase a project, guide us through building it, or even lead the session.

## Resource Summaries

### [https://lovable.dev/login](https://lovable.dev/login)
Ask Lovable to build your own app. Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN.com. Today, we're testing out a new tool that lets you test out stories on your own.

### [https://docs.cursor.com/context/ignore-files](https://docs.cursor.com/context/ignore-files)
Cursor reads and indexes your project’s codebase to power its features. You can control which directories and files Cursor can access by adding a .cursorignore file to your root directory. Cursor makes its best effort to block access to files listed in .c cursorignore from codebase indexing.
You can now define ignore patterns that apply across all projects via your user-level settings. This keeps noisy or sensitive files like build outputs or secrets out of prompts without needing per-project configuration.
Cursor is designed to support large codebases and is skilled at assessing file relevancy. The ignore feature is helpful when using a codebase that is especially large or includes files immaterial to your development. To implement Cursor’s ignore feature, add a .cursorignore file to the root of your codebase.
Cursor will search all the way up the file tree for .cursorignore files. Ignores logs directories in any directory **/logs. Blank lines are ignored. Lines starting with # are considered comments and ignored.
 defaults to ignore all files listed in the .gitignore file in your root directory and in the Default Ignore List provided below. To not ignore a file listed in these files, add it to your .cursorignore file with an ! prefix. For indexing only, the following files are also ignored.

We just built an insane no-code tool in 12 hours that makes any AI 10x more powerful in seconds. We used it to make regular Claude do what seems impossible, and it's about to change everything.
Generatemcp.com is the world's first no-code platform that lets you build custom MCPs on the fly. It's like how Neo in the Matrix instantly learned Kung Fu by downloading capabilities.
 AI fails at: Extracting data from specific websites. Running complex workflows across multiple platforms. Generating tools for AI on the fly.
At first glance, building MCPs seems unnecessarily complex. But once you start testing real use cases and iterating with LLMs like ChatGPT, you realize: it’s no different.
The breakthrough wasn’t automating everything right away, but staying in control of each step: what happens, where, and why. Once you’re in the flow, you realize how much potential remains untapped – not because of the tech, but because of missing connections.

Build and deploy Remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to Cloudflare. Weâve added four things to Cloud flare that handle the hard parts of building remote MCP servers for you. An OAuth Provider that makes authorization easy McpAgent.
MCP-remote is an adapter that lets MCP clients that otherwise only support local connections work with remote MCP servers. The button below, or the developer docs , will get you up and running in production with this example MCP server in less than two minutes.
MCP is a protocol that enables LLMs to go beyond inference and RAG. It enables AI agents to access tools and resources from external services. To date, MCP has been limited to running locally on your own machine. Support for remote MCP connections changes this.
Local MCP is great for developers, but remote MCP connections are the missing piece to reach everyone on the Internet. Making authentication and authorization just work with MCP. is like the transition from desktop software to web-based software.
Workers-oauth-provider is an OAuth 2.1 Provider library for Cloudflare Workers. It wraps your Worker’s code, adding authorization to API endpoints. Your MCP server will receive the already-authenticated user details as a parameter.

The Ecodrifter 2.0 was tested in Yamuna & Jawahar Canal. It is like a vortex completely sucking me in and I love it. I learnt that I need to add propellers in the outrigger boats too for easier maneuvering.
I surveyed the following rivers and lakes for assessing the plastic wastage in the water. Rivers were clean in the center while there was a lot of plastic on the banks. This plastic could be picked up using my device. Both the river and lakes were full of sewage and plastic waste.
Yamuna Barrage, Delhi Jawahar Canal Pump , Rewari, Haryana. Device needed sanitization after being picked up from the waters.
Boat is capable of tugging at least 80 kg to 100kg of trash. Propellers are not robust and do not generate enough thrust. They got stuck at many places due to sticks and sharp objects in the water.
The Encase Propellor collects more than a kg of trash by twisting and turning the boat in different directions. Next step would be to build a stronger propeller to ensure trash collection.

Anthropic has worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents. Consistently, the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns.
At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as agentic systems. We draw an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents. When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed.
For many applications, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough. When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency. Agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed.
We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly. Many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. See our cookbook for some sample implementations.
We recommend tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.
